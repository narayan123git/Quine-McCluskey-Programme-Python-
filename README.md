# Quine-McCluskey-Programme-Python-
Quine-McCluskey Algorithm: A Python implementation for minimizing Boolean functions. This project simplifies logic expressions by converting minterms to binary, grouping them, generating Prime Implicants, and applying dominance rules. Ideal for optimizing digital circuits by reducing complexity and improving performance.
